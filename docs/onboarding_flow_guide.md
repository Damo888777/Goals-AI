Philosophy: We demonstrate the app's value through active participation. The user plans their first goal manually, experiences success, and is then introduced to Spark as the magical shortcut for the future.
Step 0: The Start
Screen: A simple welcome screen.
Headline: Vision to Victory. Simplified.
Button: [ Start Your Journey ]
Step 1: The Name (Personal Welcome)
Headline: First, what's your name?
Sub-headline: Goals AI will use it to make your journey more personal.
Core UI: A single text field.
Button: [ Continue ]
(A discreet "Skip for now" link is available on this and all subsequent screens.)
Step 2: The Personalization (Functional Preference)
Headline: Personalize Your Visions
Sub-headline: To save you time, Spark can automatically add a subject to your prompts. What should be your default?
Core UI: Three clear button options:
[ As a man ]
[ As a woman ]
[ I'll specify in each prompt ]
Button: [ Continue ]
Step 3: The Vision (The Magic Moment)
Headline: Welcome, [Username]. Every great journey starts with a single image.
Sub-headline: What's the one dream you want to bring to life? Let's visualize it.
Core UI: The simplified "Create Vision" flow (text field for the prompt, selection of the 4 curated styles).
Button Flow: [ ✨ Generate Vision ] → (App shows the generated image) → [ Looks great, let's continue ]
Step 4: The Goal (The Definition)
Headline: Now, let's give your vision a clear name.
Sub-headline: This will be the spark that ignites your plan.
Core UI:
A text field for the Goal Title (pre-filled with the text from Step 3).
The Emotion Selector with the question: And how will you feel when you achieve it?
Button: [ Set Goal ]
Step 5: The Milestone (The First Step)
Headline: A vision is reached one step at a time.
Sub-headline: What is the very first milestone on your journey to "[User's Goal Title]"?
Core UI: A single text field with a clear example placeholder.
Button: [ Create First Milestone ]
Step 6: The Action (The Commitment)
Headline: Let's Make It Real.
Sub-headline: Turn this milestone into your first focused action.
Core UI: A text field for the first, concrete task, with the question: What is the one task you can do today to start this milestone?
The Final Button (The Payoff): [ Make it Today's Priority (Eat the Frog) ]
Step 7: The "Aha!" Moment & Spark Explanation
Action: The user taps the final button. The onboarding sequence closes.
Result: The user lands on the Today tab of the app.
The Magic Moment: The Eat the Frog block is already perfectly filled out with the task, goal, and vision image the user just created.
The Final Coaching: Immediately after the screen appears, the UI dims, a spotlight highlights the Floating Action Button (FAB), and a tooltip box appears.
Tooltip Content:
Headline: Now, Let Spark Do the Work
Body Text: Tap to speak naturally, like: "Finish the marketing report by Friday." Spark will understand the task, title, and date for you—automatically.
Sub-note (smaller text): Press and hold to add items manually.
Button: [ Got It! ]
