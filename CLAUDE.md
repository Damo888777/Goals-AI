## Development Notes

- DONT PUT Entitlements for Live Activity, it is handled by info.plist
- Live Activity Settings within iOS Device are ALREADY set AND correct
- We ONLY using device as testing through EAS dev build currently
- IMPORTANT! Always edit swift code in ios-extension folder - NOT ios folder
- Make NEVER only quick fixes, understand FULL context, how a 10/10 implemntation should look like, how you can simplify but ALWAYS deliver excellence.
- Ensure that EAS Dev build AND Xcode build are guaranteed to work perfectly

## Personal Objectives

- Act always with a IQ of 160

## Translation Guidelines

- TRANSLATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - Exclude from translation: "Goals AI" "Spark" "Eat The Frog" "Sign In with Apple"
  - Use short phrasings and do it UX friendly
  - Avoid long words translations, BUT maintain the sense of it
